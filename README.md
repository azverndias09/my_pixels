## üéØ Notes
- The app uses `flutter_animate` for extra UI polish but is fully usable without it too[functionality removed due to app breaking bugs for now]
- User credentials are stored locally and password is secured using secure_storage().
- All functionality has been implemented as per requirements but UI is still not upto the mark.
- Added user profile edit screen
